This is a simple addon to help working with the Gnu Scientific Library in OF.

Right now, there's nothing much to it: the headers and a 32 bit compiled static library. I want to make some simple translation functions to swap ofVec2f, ofVec3f, ofMat4x4 and ofMat3x3, but at the moment, it's just what it is.

You need to add the include file to your header search paths, i.e. ../../../addons/ofxGSL/libs/gsl/include to compile, 

and add libcblas and libblas to your linker settings.
