This is a simple addon to help working with the Gnu Scientific Library in OF.

I'm actually just using to help myself along with understanding this book: http://www.amazon.com/Scientific-Computing-Michael-T-Heath/dp/0072399104/ a little self education. I would, however, like to make it into something useful to people interested in doing some math-y stuff though.

GSL provides:

Complex Numbers	
Roots of Polynomials
Special Functions	
Vectors and Matrices
Permutations	
Sorting
BLAS Support	
Linear Algebra
Eigensystems	
Fast Fourier Transforms
Quadrature	
Random Numbers
Quasi-Random Sequences	
Random Distributions
Statistics	
Histograms
N-Tuples	
Monte Carlo Integration
Simulated Annealing	
Differential Equations
Interpolation	
Numerical Differentiation
Chebyshev Approximation	
Series Acceleration
Discrete Hankel Transforms	
Root-Finding
Minimization	
Least-Squares Fitting
Physical Constants	
IEEE Floating-Point
Discrete Wavelet 
Transforms	Basis splines

Right now, there's nothing much to it: the headers and a 32 bit compiled static library. I want to make some simple translation functions to swap ofVec2f, ofVec3f, ofMat4x4 and ofMat3x3, but at the moment, it's just what it is.

You need to add the include file to your header search paths, i.e. ../../../addons/ofxGSL/libs/gsl/include to compile, 

and add libcblas and libblas to your linker settings.
